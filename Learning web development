The internet is a global network of interconnected computers and servers that allows people, devices, and systems all over the world to communicate, share information, and access services.
The internet works by connecting millions of computers, phones, and servers through a vast network of cables, satellites, and wireless signals, allowing them to share information across the globe. When you request something online, like opening a website, your device sends the request in small data packets to a router, which forwards them through different pathways until they reach the correct server.

The server then processes the request, breaks its response into packets, and sends them back through the network, where your device reassembles them into the website, video, or message you see. Behind the scenes, systems like the Domain Name System (DNS) translate website names into IP addresses, and protocols like TCP/IP ensure that the data arrives in order and without errors, making online communication fast and reliable.
The Domain Name System (DNS) is like the phonebook of the internet. Computers use IP addresses to identify websites and devices, but people find it easier to remember names like google.com or youtube.com. DNS translates these human-friendly names into machine-readable IP addresses so that your device can locate and connect to the correct server.

For example, when you type www.google.com into your browser, your computer asks the DNS: “What’s the IP address for google.com?” The DNS looks it up and returns the address, allowing your request to reach Google’s servers. Without DNS, you would need to memorize long strings of numbers for every site you wanted to visit, which would make the internet far less user-friendly. While people prefer using easy-to-remember names like google.com, computers communicate using numerical addresses called IP addresses. DNS translates these domain names into IP addresses, so when you type a website name into your browser, your device knows exactly which server to contact. Without DNS, users would have to memorize long strings of numbers for every website, making the internet very difficult to use.

Here’s how it works: when you type a domain name, your device asks a DNS resolver (often provided by your internet service provider or a public DNS service like Google’s 8.8.8.8) for the corresponding IP address. If the resolver already knows the answer, it replies immediately. If not, it begins a search by asking a root DNS server where to find information about the domain’s extension (like .com). The request is then passed to the top-level domain (TLD) server, which directs the resolver to the domain’s authoritative server. That server provides the correct IP address, which is then sent back to your device so it can load the website. This entire process happens in fractions of a second, making browsing the web seamless.

A web browser is a software application, like Chrome, Safari, or Firefox, that allows you to access and interact with websites on the internet. When you type a web address (URL) into the browser, it sends a request through the internet to the website’s server using the HTTP or HTTPS protocol. The server responds by sending back files such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images, which the browser interprets and assembles into the web page you see on your screen. Browsers also handle functions like caching pages for faster loading, managing cookies to remember preferences, and running scripts for interactive content, making them the main tool for navigating and experiencing the web.

Markup languages are computer languages designed to structure, describe, and format text so that computers and humans can understand and present it properly. Instead of running commands like programming languages, markup languages use tags or symbols to define how elements of text and data should appear or be organized. For example, in HTML (HyperText Markup Language), tags like <h1> define headings, <p> defines paragraphs, and <img> adds images to a page.
They are widely used in web development, document formatting, and data storage. Some common examples include HTML for building web pages, XML for storing and transporting structured data, and Markdown for simple text formatting in documents and online platforms. In short, markup languages tell a computer what the content is and how it should be displayed or organized, rather than instructing it to perform actions like programming languages do.

Front-end development is the part of web development that focuses on what users see and interact with directly in their browser. It involves building the layout, design, and interactive features of a website or application using technologies like HTML (structure), CSS (styling), and JavaScript (interactivity). In simple terms, front-end development is about creating the user interface and ensuring that websites are responsive, visually appealing, and easy to use across different devices and screen sizes.

HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is the communication system that allows web browsers and servers to exchange information. When you type a website address or click a link, HTTP defines how your request is sent to the server and how the server sends back the web page, images, or other resources. In short, it’s the protocol that makes loading and browsing websites possible.

The web works by connecting users to information stored on servers through the internet. When you type a web address (URL) into your browser, the browser first uses the Domain Name System (DNS) to find the server’s IP address. It then sends a request to that server using HTTP or HTTPS protocols. The server responds by sending back the necessary files—such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images—which the browser interprets and assembles into the website you see on your screen. This entire process happens within seconds, allowing users to easily access and interact with websites from anywhere in the world.
